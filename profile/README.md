**Welcome to Nabla ML!** 

We are on a mission to build both scalable & interpretable AI tools in the emerging Mojo+Python ecosystem. We have started this journey with Nabla - a Python library that provides three key features for AI developers:

- Multidimensional array computation with strong GPU acceleration
- JAX-like composable function transformations: `grad`, `vmap`, `jit`, and other automatic differentiation tools
- Deep integration with the MAX compiler and custom Mojo ðŸ”¥ kernels
