We are on a mission to build both scalable & explainable AI tools in the emerging Mojo+Python ecosystem. We have started this journey with Nabla - a Python library that provides three key features for AI developers:

- Multidimensional Array computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Composable Function Transformations: vmap, grad, jit, and other Automatic Differentiation tools
- Deep integration with MAX and (custom) Mojo kernels
